# FisHy PACE: Predicting fish distributions from phytoplankton using hyperspectral satellite data

## Project Description

Our goal is to show how the new PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) dataset can enhance our ability to predict species distributions.

## Planning

-   Initial idea: Understand potential associations between phytoplankton species or abundance and adult fish functional groups or larvae respectively
-   Final idea: Predict adult fish distributions from PACE chlorophyll and absorption data and compare to predictions from MODIS chlorophyll data

## Background

PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) is NASA's newest earth-observing satellite that collects hyperspectral measurements across a broad range of visible wavelengths. The data PACE collects allows us to better resolve absorbance spectra at any given point in the ocean than previous earth-observing satellites (e.g., MODIS). This includes better estimates of Chlorophyll-A, which is highly correlated with primary production. Chlorophyll-A concentrations derived from MODIS have been previously shown to be important predictors of fish distributions and abundance.
